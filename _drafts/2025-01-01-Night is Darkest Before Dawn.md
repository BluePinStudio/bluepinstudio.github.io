## Welcome!
Hi peeps. Let's have a look at what goals I had for myself in November 2024 and which ones I completed!

## December 2024 Goals 
  - [x] Participate in the Jingle Gam Jam hosted by the Yogscast
  - [x] Participate in at least one Secret Santa
  - [x] Give away 4 Charles pins
  - [ ] Get Charles the Bee to 80 reviews
  - [x] Get Pixel Fixel to 100 reviews
  - [ ] Launch the additional new Charles the Bee content
  - [x] Sign a contract with a publisher for Project Jig

Not bad at all! Finally got the stuff storted with Apple. When people told me that publishing on ios would be difficult, i scoffed, how difficult could it be?! Turns out it involves arguing back and forth and sending multiple builds to Apple. In my case it involved sending a new build or answering a new question they posed **60** times! 


## Bonus Tasks Completed in November 2024
  - [x] Got featured on Apple's "Games We Love"

Needless to say, getting featured by Apple has a massive effect on player numbers. Check out the last few months of Pixel Fixel players!

## Footer & Note to Future Self
My 4~ year relationship came to an end! Nothing dramatic happened, moreso the culmination of some incompatibilities. If you know me personally and you want to know more, I'm an open book, but I won't vent here publically. Onwards and upwards!
