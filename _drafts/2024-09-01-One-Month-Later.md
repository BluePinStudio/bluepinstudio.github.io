It's quite an ambitious month, but I have the utmost confidence all of these tasks will be done and dusted! I have a fantastic team for the game jam, I have a fantastic team for Charles, and the stickers are already in my hands!



> Doing a game jam, while trying to launch a game, while doing a part time job, while getting ready for a vacation is not advised.

A small hiccup regarding the plans is my vacation that is planned from Aug 14 to Aug 20. Girlfriend is coming into town and we're going to spend the week doing all sorts of fun touristy stuff!



## Footer & Personal Note

This is my first time doing a blog. The aim with these blogs is to maintain a communication with my future self. Undoubtedly I will be reading this in 2024 and 2025 and beyond. So i guess I should say "Hey future me! Hope all is well, hopefully everything worked out :)" 

Also, I figure I should shoutout a song I really like this month, maybe it'll be a good nugget for my future self or any crazy people who read these...
