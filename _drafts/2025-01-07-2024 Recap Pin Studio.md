## Welcome!
Hi peeps. Let's have a look at what goals I had for myself in November 2024 and which ones I completed!

## Metrics
Let's see what we have. These are the key metrics that I would like to track compared to the same metric in the previous calendar year...


| Total Net Revenue from All Sources| **$1205 (USD)**|<span style="color:green">**+419%**</span> compared to 2023 |
| Direct Community Size|**149**|<span style="color:green">**+110%**</span> compared to 2023 |
| Auxiliary Community Size|**879**|<span style="color:green">**+87%**</span> compared to 2023 |
| Player Count Estimate|**10000**|no previous data available |
| Website/Blog Unique Visitors|**2300**|<span style="color:green">**+389%**</span> compared to 2023|

- <small>**Total net revenue** includes all sources such as game sales, merch sales, publisher payments, contest prizes, etc. This is net revenue, not gross profit or net profit. Things like the steam fee, etsy fee, etsy promoted listing fee have been subtracted already.
- <small>**Direct community size** is the size of the Discord server combined with mailing list. 
- <small>**Auxiliary community size** is a combination of all the other platform followers such as bluesky, twitter, youtube, steam, etc. 
- <small>**Player count estimate** is my best guess for how many people played all of the games I have on various platforms. With the player estimate, there is some guesswork because not ever platform reports unique users.


## Noteworthy Events
- Launched Pixel Fixel on Newgrounds, Steam, Itch, iOS, Android, Coolmathgames
- Launched Charles the Bee on Steam
- Completed 3 game jams
- Wrote 11 blog posts (including this one)
- Launched 2 pieces of merch
- Created a steam bundle containing all Blue Pin Games (more to come soon!)

## Extra Tidbit
Since its the first time I'm doing one of these, I would like to include my Total Net Revenue for all years. Just to give you a picture of the journey so far!
