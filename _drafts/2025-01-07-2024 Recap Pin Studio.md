## Welcome!
Hi peeps. Let's have a look at what goals I had for myself in November 2024 and which ones I completed!

## Metrics
Let's see what we have. These are the key metrics that I would like to track compared to the same metric in the previous calendar year...

### **Total Revenue from All Sources:** <span style="color:#0084ff">$1390</span> (<span style="color:green">+424%</span>)
### **Direct Community Size:** <span style="color:#0084ff">149</span> (no previous data available)
### **Auxiliary Community Size:** <span style="color:#0084ff">879</span> (no previous data available)
### **Player Count Estimate:** <span style="color:#0084ff">9000</span> (no previous data available)
### **Website/Blog Unique Visitors:** <span style="color:#0084ff">2300</span> (<span style="color:green">+489%</span>)

Just to explain the metrics a bit. Total revenue includes all sources such as game sales, merch sales, publisher payments, contest prizes, etc. Direct community size is the size of the Discord server combined with mailing list. Auxiliary community size is a combination of all the other platform followers such as bluesky, twitter, youtube, steam, etc. Player count estimate is my best guess for how many people played all of the games I have on various platforms. With the player estimate, there is some guesswork because not ever platform reports unique users.
