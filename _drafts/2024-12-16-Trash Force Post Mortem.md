## Introduction

During the [Yogscast Jingle Jam](https://itch.io/jam/jinglegamejam2024) game jam, we created **Trash Force**. The theme was **Everything has a Cost**, and we had 7 days comsplete the game. The team consisted of Myself (Viktor), Mike (Strollart), PixelPigeon and RedCocoa.



## Timeline

### Pre-Jam
Getting the team set up in google drive, getting hyped and getting ready to brainstorm. Despite knowing the theme in advance due to Yogscast sharing it to us early, we wanted to wait until the jam starts to brainstorm the game designs. This way we can start creating assets and prototypes without accidentally working prior to the jam starting.

### The first half...
Noon on a Sunday, we got on a call and begin pitching ideas. We pitched everything from Plants vs Zombies to Chicken Invaders, to Asteroids, to retro driving and racing games. We started working through all the technical details of the game such as the resolution, art styles, and things we specifically wanted to avoid. By the time the night came around, we managed to narrow it down to an Asteroids-like with tons of upgrades that cost money.

Over the next few days we spent a lot of time getting the basics down. A functional web build using asteroids-like mechanics, some mockups for HUDs and menus.

_Working on the menus_

We spent a bunch of time battling with Itch outages and revising all of the HUD/Menu assets.

Right at the end of the first half, we have a near-final version of the title screen and some fantastic animations for the hands. Look at them go! This was the day one of our artists, PixelPigeon, started feeling sick. That spooked the heck out of me! Losing an artist halfway through the process would've caused us to cut down the scope dramatically.

### The second half...
Onwards, we started refining the game systems. We had so many google docs for potential upgrades. Some of the upgrades that didn't make the cut are :
- **Backshot upgrade**	
    - When player shoots, shoots an additional bullet behind them simutaniously. Does not consume any additional ammo 
- **Hardhead upgrade**	
    - Player now damages asteroids when they bump into them (but still takes damage)
- **Stickers upgrade**	
    - Adds a sticker to your laptop (permanant)
- **Fez (hat) upgrade**	
    - Gives your possum a pretty hat
- **Gassy upgrade**	
    - Eat trash to gain a small amount of fuel
- **Beans**	
    - Drops a fart cloud every X seconds that breaks trash.  dissapears after awhile
- **Space Roombas**	
    - 2 Roombas circle around the player hitting trashteroids and cleaning small trash should have health

- **Comment from Mike (Artist)**: We created a concept that was a modern twist on an oldschool classic. I came in with this being an experiment of what we could do with a small idea, and it went really well
- **Comment from PixelPigeon (Artist)**: We had a good amount of time to work on this project and the team was able come together on the vision quite quickly. The programmers experience in game jams was definitely helpful.
- **Comment from RedCocoa (Musician)**: abc

- **Comment from Mike (Artist)**: Main challenge was just staying on top of documents. We were a new team for each other so everyone had a slightly different way of communicating.
- **Comment from PixelPigeon (Artist)**: I got friggin COVID midway through and it sucked.

- **Comment from Mike (Artist)**: Felt great about the outcome. We were only a few submissions shy of not even being seen on the livestream, and had that happened we would not have even won an award or had such great soundbites about what we made. Was very worth it in the end
- **Comment from PixelPigeon (Artist)**: Hey I just wanted to make a cool game with a team quickly and we did.
- **Comment from RedCocoa (Musician)**: abc



## Reception

**Final Game**: We had 150 people leave try it out and leave lots of comments as well. This jam didn't have a rating period where fellow jammers played our game so there were no scores. HOWEVER! We did get our game featured on the Yogscast stream where Lewis, Pedguin and Jennifer played our game and loved it!

They loved it so much that they awarded us Best Visual Design out of all games they reviewed. Therefore, in our eyes, we won the jam! At least we tied for first place with 6 other games. :)
