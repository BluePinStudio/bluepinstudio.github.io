## What Went Well

abc

- **Comment from Mike (Artist)**: We created a concept that was a modern twist on an oldschool classic. I came in with this being an experiment of what we could do with a small idea, and it went really well
- **Comment from PixelPigeon (Artist)**: We had a good amount of time to work on this project and the team was able come together on the vision quite quickly. The programmers experience in game jams was definitely helpful.
- **Comment from RedCocoa (Musician)**: abc


## Challenges

abc

- **Comment from Mike (Artist)**: Main challenge was just staying on top of documents. We were a new team for each other so everyone had a slightly different way of communicating.
- **Comment from PixelPigeon (Artist)**: I got friggin COVID midway through and it sucked.
- **Comment from RedCocoa (Musician)**: abc


## The Final Product

- **Comment from Mike (Artist)**: Felt great about the outcome. We were only a few submissions shy of not even being seen on the livestream, and had that happened we would not have even won an award or had such great soundbites about what we made. Was very worth it in the end
- **Comment from PixelPigeon (Artist)**: Hey I just wanted to make a cool game with a team quickly and we did.
- **Comment from RedCocoa (Musician)**: abc



## Reception

**Final Game**: We had 150 people leave try it out and leave lots of comments as well. This jam didn't have a rating period where fellow jammers played our game so there were no scores. HOWEVER! We did get our game featured on the Yogscast stream where Lewis, Pedguin and Jennifer played our game and loved it!

They loved it so much that they awarded us Best Visual Design out of all games they reviewed. Therefore, in our eyes, we won the jam! At least we tied for first place with 6 other games. :)


Have a look at the judge's reaction to our game!
