## Welcome!

We're back for a checkup! September was particularly rough for my personal life, so I didn't get a ton of gamedev stuff done. That's the trouble with trying to work on games as much as possible, you sometimes run out of money :P Any who! Here are the goals I posted for September (minus one of the goals, because it was an October goal accidentally included):

## September 2024 Goals Completed
  - [ ] Release Android & iOS Pixel Fixel
  - [ ] Put stickers up all over town promoting Pixel Fixel
  - [ ] Promote the heck out Charles, achieving 70 reviews by the end of the month.
  - [ ] Post Charles to Itch & Steam Linux
  - [ ] Redo Charles and Pixel Fixel steam pages to include gifs and fancy art inside the descriptions.

As I  mentioned, not a lot accomplished out of the planned tasks (oops)! But I did manage some additional tasks that weren't planned:  

## Bonus Tasks Completed in September 2024
  - [x] Big refeactor to Charles, including new game modes (not launched yet)
  - [x] Introduced the [Blue Pin Super Fan bundle](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/45349/Blue_Pin_Super_Fan/) on Steam
  - [x] Started up the Explory Story development process

That's right! [Explory Story](https://explorystory.com/) is back on the menu! We're entering the series of sprints to complete the project after it being on the backburner for so long. Most news to come!

  - [ ] Show off Charles the Bee, and Construct 3, at an in-person event as a speaker
  - [ ] Refactor Explory Story game design and sprint planning for Launch in March 2025
  - [ ] Finish iOS registration process and launch Pixel Fixel on ios!
  - [ ] Put stickers up all over town promoting Pixel Fixel
  - [ ] Promote the heck out Charles, achieving 80 reviews by the end of the month.

October is going to be quite an assorted month, substantial work across three game projects! I'm confident I will have enough time, but I guess we'll see next month!

## Footer & Note to Future Self
Here's another song. This one is a bit raunchy in parts but I simply cannot resist the vibe. I think I listened to it 50 times since I found it. Judge me if you want, but I think it's immaculate vibes.
