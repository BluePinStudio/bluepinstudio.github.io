## Welcome!

Ahoy and Ahoy! Welcome to the second monthly check-in. Here are the goals I had for August, let's see how many I completed!  

## August 2024 Goals Completed
  - [x] Complete [Do You Wanna Jam?!](https://itch.io/jam/do-you-wanna-jam-2024) Jam
  - [x] Release [Charles the Bee](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2485090/Charles_the_Bee/) on Steam
  - [x] Relax for a week (staycation)
  - [x] Update Charles, Release on Itch & Newgrounds
  - [ ] Release Android & iOS Pixel Fixel
  - [ ] Put stickers up all over town promoting Pixel Fixel
  - [ ] Promote the heck out Charles, achieving 50 reviews by the end of the month.

Regarding Pixel Fixel, the android version has been deployed, but I'm dragging my feet a little bit when it comes to the ios version. Lots of papers to fill out, lots of stuff to do on that front! Should be good to go in September tho!

Regarding promoting the heck out of Charles and releasing Charles on Itch and Newgrounds... I didn't do these tasks because I realized the game was not in a good state to be shown off as much as possible. The early players of the game have pointed out a lot of flaws and I will be spending tons of time in the coming weeks addressing those flaws and improving the game.

> I almost didn't make it to this month. I talked about that in this post: <https://blog.bluepinstudio.com/posts/Game-Launch-&-Near-Death/>

I should expand on the Staycation I did as well. I went to all sorts of places around Toronto (the city I live in) with my girlfriend! We went to have dinner on a boat cruise, brunch in a castle, checked out the animals at the Zoo, checked out the yearly carnival that comes to town, some great food spots, and generally had an amazing adventure! This was my second time doing a staycation in Toronto and I think im running out of new things to experience. There's probably enough stuff for roughly 1 more of these!

## Bonus Tasks Completed in August 2024
  - [x] Added multiplayer and new arcade mode to Charles
  - [x] Ran successful Pixel Fixel tournament

In addition to the tasks I planned for myself in August, I have also completed work on Charles Multiplayer mode and had a Pixel Fixel tournament! The pixel fixel tournament was very successful and had the most participants out of all the tournaments I've run for Pixel Fixel thus far! Very nice bonus points!

## Goals for September 2024
  - [ ] Release Android & iOS Pixel Fixel
  - [ ] Put stickers up all over town promoting Pixel Fixel
  - [ ] Promote the heck out Charles, achieving 70 reviews by the end of the month.
  - [ ] Release 6 new songs & new locations for Charles
  - [ ] Post Charles to Itch & Steam Linux
  - [ ] Redo Charles and Pixel Fixel steam pages to include gifs and fancy art inside the descriptions.
    


## Footer & Personal Note
The traditional of leaving myself a song continues! I hope I don't look back at this selections and cringe. The phrase "if you aren't cringing at your past self, you aren't growing" comes to mind :P

Oh also, as an actual note for myself : good luck in September 2024 buddy! Related to what you check every morning.
