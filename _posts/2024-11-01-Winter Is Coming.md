## Welcome!
Hi peeps. Let's have a look at what goals I had for myself in November 2024 and which ones I completed!

## November 2024 Goals Completed
  - [x] Deal with the remaining iOS rejections and finally publish Pixel Fixel on iOS
  - [x] Put stickers up all over town promoting Pixel Fixel
  - [ ] Promote the heck out Charles, achieving 80 reviews by the end of the month.
  - [ ] Launch the additional new Charles the Bee content
  - [ ] Sign a contract with a publisher for Project Jig

Not bad at all! Finally got the stuff storted with Apple. When people told me that publishing on ios would be difficult, i scoffed, how difficult could it be?! Turns out it involves arguing back and forth and sending multiple builds to Apple. In my case it involved sending a new build or answering a new question they posed **60** times! 

> Waking up with a new rejection from Apple every morning for an entire month can be a frustrating way to start the day!

Despite that, eventually everything was sorted out and the game has been deployed. The game is already getting good traction on apple and android! Partially, I hope, due to my sticker strategy. The other part of the goal related to releasing Pixel Fixel on ios was finally being able to try out a new marketing strategy: putting stickers all over town.

At the time of writing this, 40 people have scanned the stickers and have been redirected to google play store or apple app store based on their operating system. Hopefully next month I will be able to report an even higher number, but who knows, it gets cold out here in December.

## Bonus Tasks Completed in November 2024
  - [x] Launch a new enamel pin onto the Blue Pin etsy page! (Moo deng has arrived!)
  - [x] Upgrade Pixel Fixel in various ways (splash screens, dlc page, etc) and launch Pixel Fixel on Epic Game Store and Game Jolt
  - [x] Prepare a pitch deck for an unannounced board game and send it out to the relevant parties.

 Look at all those (chickens) extra things I accomplished! Quiet a successful month if you ask me. If you're intrigued about the Moo Deng pin, [head on over here](https://moodengpin.com/)! I'm going to try to slowly expand my enamel pin offerings, gives another vector for generating revenue and giveaways. Not to mention its quite fun! I love roleplaying as a merchant.

 Last thing to do is to define the goals for December and get to work!

## December 2024 Goals 
  - [ ] Participate in the Jingle Gam Jam hosted by the Yogscast
  - [ ] Participate in at least one Secret Santa
  - [ ] Give away 4 Charles pins
  - [ ] Get Charles the Bee to 80 reviews
  - [ ] Get Pixel Fixel to 100 reviews
  - [ ] Launch the additional new Charles the Bee content
  - [ ] Sign a contract with a publisher for Project Jig

## Footer & Note to Future Self
November was not as bad as October, and I suspect December won't be as bad as November. So things are slowly improving on all fronts! Let's hope the momentum keeps up and I can report even greater news in the next year. Still working on getting my first publisher deal, so hopefully thats penned shortly too!

Here is another song, this time it's brought to you buy a [twitch streamer named Zombiechou](https://www.twitch.tv/zombiechou). He was playing it in his stream (lol) and my mind was blown by the beauty! Let's all have some high high hopes for a living, like Mr. Zombiechou!
