## Welcome!
Hi peeps. Let's have a look at what goals I had! And then I'll tell you about my second time in my life going to the hospital in an ambulance :O

## October 2024 Goals Completed
  - [x] Complete Ludum Dare 56 game jam
  - [ ] Show off Charles the Bee, and Construct 3, at an in-person event as a speaker
  - [x] Refactor Explory Story game design and sprint planning for Launch in March 2025
  - [ ] Finish iOS registration process and launch Pixel Fixel on ios!
  - [ ] Put stickers up all over town promoting Pixel Fixel
  - [ ] Promote the heck out Charles, achieving 80 reviews by the end of the month.
  - [x] Prepare the new Charles the Bee content for launch in first week of November on Newgrounds & Steam

  Oof! That doesn't look too good! Howcome you weren't able to even to show off charles? That seems like an easy task, i hear you ask. Well it would've been pretty straight forward but i got pretty sick. No bueno. A few days after flopping on going to that event i was feeling really nauseous and ended up calling 911 to rescue me. I haven't puked that much in years... Anywho, i don't want to go into too much details but i spent roughly 24hrs in the hospital and the same amount recovering at home.

  What about the other goals like ios pixel fixel and putting up stickers? Well the stickers depend on ios launch and apple keeps rejecting me. November will be the month for ios pixel fixel tho! Suuuurely! 

  And lastly, the Charles update? Bah! Other things got priority, November will be the month for charles update tho! Suuurely!

  It's not all bad news, I accomplished a few tasks including my Ludum Dare entry and the following unscheduled tasks:

## Bonus Tasks Completed in October 2024
  - [x] Begun manufacturing for a new enamel pin to add to the catalog on Etsy
  - [x] Begun work on a secret project (Project Jig) in hopes to publish with a third party
  - [x] Pixel Fixel tournament and launch additional game mode

It's time to put the pedal to the metal and get those pesky lingering tasks done in November. Do tasks or die trying, amirite?

## Goals for November  2024
  - [ ] Deal with the remaining iOS rejections and finally publish Pixel Fixel on iOS
  - [ ] Put stickers up all over town promoting Pixel Fixel
  - [ ] Promote the heck out Charles, achieving 80 reviews by the end of the month.
  - [ ] Launch the additional new Charles the Bee content
  - [ ] Sign a contract with a publisher for Project Jig
    
Good luck to us all!

## Footer & Note to Future Self
The months get tougher and tougher! Luckily T-Pain released a song that I vibe with heavy. Say less fam.
