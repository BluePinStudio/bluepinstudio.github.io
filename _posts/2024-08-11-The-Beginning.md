## Welcome!

Ahoy and Ahoy! Welcome to the first blog post on the site :) This blog, and blogging in general was inspired by realising I've been on the game dev journey for over 4 years and have almost no chronicle of what I was up to each month. Special shoutout to [Tim Beaudet](https://www.timbeaudet.com), his archiving skills are like non-other. I'll try my best to evolve this blog to include post mortems, monthly check-ins, and yearly roundups. 

Let's pretend today is **August 1st**, I'll write down some goals and we'll see how well they went next month. We'll do one of these on the 1st of every month. (Side note: imagine if it was easy as that. Just say you'll do something every month and end up doing it every month as planned)

## Goals for August 2024
  - [ ] Complete [Do You Wanna Jam?!](https://itch.io/jam/do-you-wanna-jam-2024) Jam
  - [ ] Release [Charles the Bee](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2485090/Charles_the_Bee/) on Steam
  - [ ] Relax for a week (staycation)
  - [ ] Update Charles, Release on Itch & Newgrounds
  - [ ] Release Android & iOS Pixel Fixel
  - [ ] Put stickers up all over town promoting Pixel Fixel
  - [ ] Promote the heck out Charles, achieving 50 reviews by the end of the month.

It's quite an ambitious month, but I have the utmost confidence all of these tasks will be done and dusted! I have a fantastic team for the game jam, I have a fantastic team for Charles, and the stickers are already in my hands!



> Doing a game jam, while trying to launch a game, while doing a part time job, while getting ready for a vacation is not advised.

A small hiccup regarding the plans is my vacation that is planned from Aug 14 to Aug 20. Girlfriend is coming into town and we're going to spend the week doing all sorts of fun touristy stuff!



## Footer & Personal Note

This is my first time doing a blog. The aim with these blogs is to maintain a communication with my future self. Undoubtedly I will be reading this in 2024 and 2025 and beyond. So i guess I should say "Hey future me! Hope all is well, hopefully everything worked out :)" 

Also, I figure I should shoutout a song I really like this month, maybe it'll be a good nugget for my future self or any crazy people who read these...
